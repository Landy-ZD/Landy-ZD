## 📝 About Me

I used to worked at global top executive search firms, helping leading companies around the world recruit senior executives in the Asia-Pacific region. I also supported outstanding Chinese enterprises in building companies from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 100.

A humanities student who unexpectedly ventured into the medical field, I set out on the path of serial entrepreneurship in my thirties, and embracing a third transformation around 40!

Stay hungry, stay foolish! Forever curious, always exploring and always growing!

**What I do:** Executive search / Talent acquisition / Build company from 0 / Professional training / Networking / Investment
